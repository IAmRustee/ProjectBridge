**Section IIB: Commit Message Guidelines**
1. **Your commit message title must be short, clean and concise.** This makes it easy to see which commit did what.
2. **Detail all changes made in a commit message.** This makes it easier to track what your commit changes in detail.
3. **Include the current version in your commit title.** Use versioning in your commit messages such as the ff: "Bug Fixes 0.0.1-1". The format is as follows: [Commit Title] (AppVersion)-(**N**th commit number in that version.) See [this](https://github.com/IAmRustee/Rustee-s-Glamorous-Textures/commits/main/) for reference. This makes it easy to see which commit belongs to what version. **Updates in the README.md files doesn't need this.**
